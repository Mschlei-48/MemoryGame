  <li>You can click on two cards at a time.</li>
  <li>If the letters on the two cards do not match, the cards will flip and the letters will be hidden again.</li>
  <li>You have to MEMORISE the position of the letters so that you can be able to flip cards with the same letters.</li>
  <li>If the letters on the two cards match, they remain on their front-side which reveals their letters.</li>
  <li>To win the game, all cards must be matched and all must be on their front-side with their letters revealed.</li>
